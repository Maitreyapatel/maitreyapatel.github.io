I am a senior Ph.D. student at Arizona State University (ASU). I am working alongside [Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu) and [Chitta Baral](https://cogintlab-asu.github.io/). I closely collaborate with [Tejas Gokhale](https://www.tejasgokhale.com) and [Changhoon Kim](https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/changhoonkim).


<!-- My research focuses on the `theoretical foundations of visual generative models` (e.g., diffusion and flow models) and their applications in conditional sampling, including personalization, inverse problems, and image/video editing. Additionally, I am interested in representation learning, the development of large-scale multimodal foundational models, and `inference-time steering/guiding` generative models dynamically at inference to improve controllability and reliability. **I firmly believe that true World Models must be generalizable, efficient, controllable, responsible, and grounded in physical laws.** -->

My research focuses on the `theoretical foundations of visual generative models` and their applications in conditional sampling, including image/video editing, inverse problems, and personalization. I am also interested in representation learning, large-scale multimodal foundational models, and `inference-time steering` to enhance the controllability and reliability of generative models. **I believe true World Models must be generalizable, efficient, controllable, responsible, and grounded in physical laws.**

Alongside my research, I am writing [The Stochastic Journey](https://the-stochastic-journey.github.io/) â€” a blog series that delves into the mathematical foundations of generative models, tracing their roots in stochastic calculus, probability theory, and differential equations. 

<!-- My focus lies in the domain of `Robust and Reliability` for Vision-Language. Currently, I specialize in computer vision, specifically generative and diffusion models, concept algebra, model attribution, and few-shot learning. I firmly believe that advancing `Representation Learning` is essential for enhancing the compositionality and reliability of machine learning systems in the long run. -->

<!-- Aside from academics, I enjoy working on intriguing open-source projects. Recently, I have dedicated my free time to developing [reliability-checklist](https://github.com/Maitreyapatel/reliability-checklist) (v0.1.0 released) and [AInos](https://ainosai.com) (under review for product market fit). -->



<p style="color:red;">I always look for self-motivated students who want to focus on either fundamental problems or responsibility aspects of Generative AI. If you have prior experience in related fields, feel free to reach out to me if you are interested.</p>
