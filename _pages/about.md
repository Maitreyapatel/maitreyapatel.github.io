I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Arizona State University (ASU). I receieved my master's in computer science with a [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/a3e03e583ae1ebb3be1004f80efc1261/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) in December 2022 from ASU.

<!-- I am a second year PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU). I will be receiving my masters in computer science with thesis in December, 2022 from ASU. I will be `continuing my ongoing research work as a part of my graduate studies`.  -->


I work with [Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu) and [Chitta Baral](https://cogintlab-asu.github.io/) and closely collaborate with [Tejas Gokhale](https://www.tejasgokhale.com) (Ph.D. candidate).  

My goal as a Ph.D. student is to pursue research in the domain of `Robust and Efficient` Multi-modal representation learning. To achieve this, I genuinely believe that `Counterfactual/Causal Reasoning` will play the most important role. Apart from this, Iâ€™m super interested in using `Language as a Computation tool` for robotics tasks and Visual Language Navigation.

Apart from academics, I like to work on interesting open-source projects. Recently, I'm spending my free time developing [reliability-score](https://github.com/Maitreyapatel/reliability-score) (coming soon -- will be released on March'23) and [not-so-secure-ai](https://github.com/Maitreyapatel/not-so-secure-ai) (under review for product market fit).
