I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University (ASU). I am working alongside [Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu) and [Chitta Baral](https://cogintlab-asu.github.io/). I closely collaborate with [Tejas Gokhale](https://www.tejasgokhale.com) and [Changhoon Kim](https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/changhoonkim).


My focus lies in the domain of `Robust and Reliability` for Vision-Language. Currently, I specialize in computer vision, specifically generative and diffusion models, concept algebra, model attribution, and few-shot learning. I firmly believe that advancing `Representation Learning` is essential for enhancing the compositionality and reliability of machine learning systems in the long run.

<!-- Aside from academics, I enjoy working on intriguing open-source projects. Recently, I have dedicated my free time to developing [reliability-checklist](https://github.com/Maitreyapatel/reliability-checklist) (v0.1.0 released) and [AInos](https://ainosai.com) (under review for product market fit). -->



<p style="color:red;">I always look for self-motivated students who want to focus on either fundamental problems or responsibility aspects of Generative AI. If you have prior experience in related fields, feel free to reach out to me if you are interested.</p>
