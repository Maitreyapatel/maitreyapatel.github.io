I am a second year PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU). I will be receiving my masters in computer science with thesis in December, 2022 from ASU. I will be `continuing my ongoing research work as a part of my graduate studies`. 


I work with [Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu) and [Chitta Baral](https://cogintlab-asu.github.io/), and closely collaborate with [Tejas Gokhale](https://www.tejasgokhale.com) (PhD candidate).  


My goal as a PhD student is to persue the research in the domain of `Robust and Efficient` Multi-modal representation learning. To acheive this, I truly believe that `Counterfactual/Causal Reasoning` will play the msot important role. Apart from this, I'm super interested in using `Language as a Computation tool` for robotics tasks and Visual Language Navigation.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
